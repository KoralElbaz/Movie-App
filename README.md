# Getting Started with Create React App

This project focuses on frontend development. 
I have created a responsive movie app that fetches movie data from an API and displays it on the screen. 

Additionally, users can search for movies and view detailed information about each movie. 

The primary objective of this project was to learn React and build a responsive application that is suitable for different devices, including computers, tablets, and smartphones.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

## Images

### These images illustrate the responsiveness of the application:

### Search movies:

#### I entered the word 'Man' as a search term to find movies that contain this word.

#### The result I got on large screens is: (of course there is compatibility on other screens)
